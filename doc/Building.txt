Requirements:
* A C++ compiler with good C++11 support. The following compilers have been
  tested: MSVC 2013 and 2015, Clang 3.4.1, GCC 5.3.1.
* Qt 5.4.1 or newer
* Boost.Iostreams


Building on Windows

A solution file for Visual Studio 2015 is provided. It can also be used with
2013, but the toolchain version of each project must be changed to use v12,
instead of the 2015 default v14.
Before building, Visual Studio must be configured to use the correct Qt version,
as well as Boost.Iostreams and whatever other Boost libraries it depends on.
Building the entire solution builds everything required by the application,
including the serializer generator which is ran during the build process.


Building on Linux/BSD

Before building the application proper, be sure to run build_serialization.sh to
build the serializer generator and generate the serialization code. This script
assumes that c++ refers to the default C++ compiler for the system.

A .pro file for use with Qt Creator is provided. Before building, it should be
configured to use the correct Qt version, and the Boost libraries should be
visible to the compiler.
Building the project should generate the final executable.
